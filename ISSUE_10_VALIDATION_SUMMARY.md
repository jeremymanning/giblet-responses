# Issue #10 Validation Summary: Text Temporal Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Issue**: Fix and validate text temporal alignment (part of Master Issue #20)
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - NO FIXES NEEDED

## Executive Summary

The text temporal alignment code in `giblet/data/text.py` is **CORRECT**. The overlap logic properly uses timing information from `annotations.xlsx` to align text features with fMRI TRs (TR = 1.5 seconds).

**Key Finding**: The code uses `floor` and `ceil` operations which correctly implement the overlap condition: `(segment_start < tr_end) AND (segment_end > tr_start)`.

## Validation Results

### 1. Code Review

**File**: `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/giblet/data/text.py`

**Key Implementation** (lines 204-220):
```python
for seg_idx, row in annotations.iterrows():
    start_time = row['Start Time (s)']
    end_time = row['End Time (s)']

    # Find TRs that overlap with this segment
    # TR i covers time [i * TR, (i+1) * TR)
    start_tr = int(np.floor(start_time / self.tr))
    end_tr = int(np.ceil(end_time / self.tr))

    # Clamp to valid TR range
    start_tr = max(0, start_tr)
    end_tr = min(n_trs, end_tr)

    # Add this segment to all overlapping TRs
    for tr_idx in range(start_tr, end_tr):
        tr_contributors[tr_idx].append(seg_idx)
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ Uses `Start Time (s)` and `End Time (s)` columns correctly
- ✅ Handles column name cleaning (strips trailing spaces)
- ✅ Overlap calculation is mathematically correct
- ✅ Handles edge cases (boundaries, clamping)

### 2. Manual Verification

**Tested**: First 10 TRs manually calculated vs code output
**Result**: 100% match (10/10 TRs)

**Example** (TR 0):
- TR time window: [0.0s, 1.5s)
- Code assigns: Segments 0 and 482 (both span [0.0s, 12.0s))
- Manual calculation: Segments 0 and 482
- ✅ MATCH

### 3. Automated Validation

**Script**: `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/validate_text_timing.py`

**Results**:
```
Total TRs tested: 920
Overlaps calculated: 920
Ground truth matches: 920/920 (100%)
```

**Statistics**:
- TRs with annotations: 920/920 (100.0%)
- TRs with gaps: 0/920 (0.0%)
- Max annotations per TR: 4
- Mean annotations per TR: 2.67
- Median annotations per TR: 3.0

### 4. Edge Cases Validated

✅ **Multiple overlapping annotations per TR**:
- Found 595 TRs with multiple annotations
- Mean aggregation verified correct
- Example: TR 11 has 4 overlapping annotations (segments 2, 3, 484, 485)

✅ **Exact TR boundaries**:
- Multiple annotations start/end exactly at TR boundaries (e.g., 0s, 12s, 15s)
- Code correctly assigns to proper TRs

✅ **No gaps in coverage**:
- All 920 TRs have at least one annotation
- Forward fill not needed (but implemented for other datasets)

✅ **Annotation aggregation**:
- When multiple annotations overlap a TR, mean aggregation is applied correctly
- Verified numerically for sample TRs

## Dataset Information

**File**: `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/data/annotations.xlsx`

**Structure**:
- Total annotations: 1000 (includes duplicates for Part 1/Part 2)
- Unique time segments: 942
- Duration: 0s to 1544s (~25.7 minutes)
- TR: 1.5 seconds
- Total TRs needed: 920 for Part 1 (~23 minutes)

**Key Columns**:
- `Start Time (s)` - Segment start time ✅
- `End Time (s)` - Segment end time ✅
- `Scene Details - A Level` - Scene descriptions
- `Name - All` - Character names
- `Location` - Scene location

**Note**: Column names have trailing spaces in Excel file, but code correctly strips them (line 111).

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/validate_text_timing.py` - Validation script
2. `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/validation_text_timing.txt` - Detailed TR-by-TR report (first 50 TRs)
3. `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/ISSUE_10_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified:
1. `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/tests/data/test_text.py` - Added two new tests:
   - `test_temporal_overlap_logic()` - Validates overlap calculation
   - `test_multiple_overlapping_segments()` - Validates aggregation

## Test Coverage

**New Tests Added**:

1. **`test_temporal_overlap_logic()`**:
   - Loads real annotations from `data/annotations.xlsx`
   - Compares code's TR assignments with ground truth overlap calculation
   - Tests first 10 TRs in detail
   - Checks boundary cases

2. **`test_multiple_overlapping_segments()`**:
   - Verifies handling of TRs with multiple annotations
   - Tests mean aggregation numerically
   - Uses real data with random embeddings

**Existing Tests** (already passing):
- `test_load_annotations()` - Loads 1000 annotations
- `test_combine_text_columns()` - Combines text columns
- `test_annotations_to_embeddings_shape()` - Correct output shape
- `test_tr_alignment_coverage()` - TR coverage statistics
- And 7 more existing tests

## Conclusions

### No Code Changes Required

The temporal alignment implementation is **correct and validated**. No bugs were found.

### Key Strengths

1. **Correct overlap logic**: Uses floor/ceil which properly implements overlap condition
2. **Robust handling**: Correctly handles multiple overlaps, boundaries, gaps
3. **Clean data loading**: Strips whitespace from column names
4. **Flexible aggregation**: Supports mean, first, last, max for multiple overlaps
5. **Gap filling**: Implements forward_fill, zero, interpolate strategies

### Recommendations

1. **Keep validation script**: `validate_text_timing.py` can be run periodically to verify correctness
2. **Run new tests**: The two new tests provide ongoing validation (though they take time due to model loading)
3. **Monitor edge cases**: If using different datasets, verify no gaps or ensure gap_fill strategy is appropriate

## Validation Artifacts

### Detailed Report

See `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/validation_text_timing.txt` for:
- First 50 TRs with detailed annotation listings
- Edge case analysis (gaps, overlaps, boundaries)
- Full statistics

### Example Output (TR 11 with 4 overlapping annotations):

```
TR  11: [  16.5s,   18.0s)
  4 annotation(s) overlap:
    Seg    2: [  15.0s,   17.0s) - Men sing in reply: "the popcorn can't be beat!"
    Seg    3: [  17.0s,   23.0s) - A family of four, a father with a black suit...
    Seg  484: [  15.0s,   17.0s) - Men sing in reply: "the popcorn can't be beat!"
    Seg  485: [  17.0s,   23.0s) - A family of four, a father with a black suit...
```

This TR has 2 unique annotations (segments 2/484 are duplicates, 3/485 are duplicates), both of which overlap the TR window. The code correctly identifies all 4 and will average their embeddings.
