# Comprehensive Research Report: Temporal Modeling for Multimodal fMRI Autoencoders

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Context:** Audio reconstruction quality improvement (Issue #12, #14)
**Objective:** Survey state-of-the-art temporal modeling approaches for preserving audio/video dynamics in fMRI prediction

---

## Executive Summary

Current audio reconstruction loses all temporal detail (speech, music, sound effects) due to simple averaging of ~64 mel frames per TR (1.5s). Video similarly loses motion information through frame averaging. This report surveys state-of-the-art temporal modeling approaches to preserve these dynamics while maintaining alignment with fMRI's TR-level sampling.

### Key Findings

1. **Multi-scale temporal convolutions** offer the best balance of parameter efficiency and temporal modeling capability
2. **Temporal attention mechanisms** are powerful but computationally expensive
3. **3D CNNs for video** are standard practice in video understanding (I3D, SlowFast)
4. **Hierarchical temporal encoding** can capture both fine-grained (phoneme) and coarse-grained (word/phrase) structure
5. **Recent fMRI reconstruction papers** successfully decode audio/video despite TR-level sampling by leveraging spatial patterns

### Top Recommendations

**Tier 1 (Best Performance/Efficiency Ratio):**
1. Multi-scale temporal convolutions with learned aggregation (~20-50M params)
2. Temporal positional encoding (minimal params, immediate benefit)

**Tier 2 (Higher Quality, More Expensive):**
3. 3D convolutions for video motion (~50-200M params)
4. Hierarchical temporal encoding with attention (~30-100M params)

**Memory Budget:** 8× A6000 GPUs (48GB each) = 384GB total, sufficient for all proposed approaches

## 1. Literature Review: Temporal Modeling Architectures

### 1.1 Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutions

#### Architecture Principles
Multi-scale temporal convolutions use parallel convolutional branches with different kernel sizes to capture temporal patterns at multiple timescales simultaneously.

**Key Papers:**
- **WaveNet (2016, DeepMind):** Introduced dilated causal convolutions with exponentially increasing dilation rates, enabling large receptive fields without excessive parameters
- **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN, 2018):** Generalized WaveNet for sequence modeling tasks
- **Supervised Attention Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Network (SA-MSTCN, 2024):** Applied multi-scale TCN to speech enhancement with attention mechanisms

**Architecture Details:**
```
Parallel branches with kernel sizes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
├─ k=1: Captures instantaneous features
├─ k=3: Phoneme-level patterns (~40-60ms)
├─ k=5: Syllable-level patterns (~100-200ms)
├─ k=7: Word-level patterns (~300-500ms)
└─ k=11: Phrase-level patterns (~500-1000ms)

Output: Concatenate all branches → Rich multi-scale representation
```

**Advantages:**
- Captures short-term (phonemes, frames) and long-term (words, motions) patterns simultaneously
- Parameter efficient: Each branch only processes its own scale
- No recurrent connections → fully parallelizable
- Proven effective in speech enhancement, music processing, video action recognition

**Parameter Estimate:** ~10-50M additional parameters
- 5 parallel branches × 128 channels × 3 layers = ~10M params (lightweight)
- 5 parallel branches × 256 channels × 5 layers = ~50M params (full capacity)

**Memory Requirements:** ~2-5GB additional GPU memory for activations

### 1.2 Temporal Attention Mechanisms

#### Self-Attention Over Time
Transformers and their variants apply self-attention mechanisms to temporal sequences, learning which moments in time are most important.

**Key Papers:**
- **TimeSformer (2021, Facebook AI):** "Divided attention" approach separating temporal and spatial attention
- **VideoMAE (2022):** Masked autoencoding for video with tube masking strategy
- **Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (2024):** Unified attention over audio-video-text modalities

**Architecture Details:**
```
For each TR window (64 frames):
1. Temporal positional encoding: [0/64, 1/64, ..., 63/64]
2. Self-attention over frame dimension:
   Q, K, V = Linear(frames)  # (64, d_model)
   Attention = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_model)) V
3. Learn which frames within TR are important
4. Aggregate to TR-level representation
```

**TimeSformer Divided Attention:**
- **Temporal attention:** Attend across frames at same spatial location
- **Spatial attention:** Attend across spatial locations in same frame
- **Separation reduces complexity** from O(N²) to O(2N) where N = spatial × temporal tokens

**Advantages:**
- Captures long-range dependencies in time
- Learns adaptive importance weighting (not all frames equal)
- Proven effective in video understanding (Kinetics-400: 93.8% accuracy)
- Natural fit for variable-length sequences

**Disadvantages:**
- Computationally expensive: O(N²) complexity for full attention
- Requires more parameters than convolutions
- Needs careful positional encoding design

**Parameter Estimate:** ~30-80M additional parameters
- Small transformer: 4 layers × 8 heads × 512 dims = ~30M params
- Medium transformer: 6 layers × 12 heads × 768 dims = ~80M params

**Memory Requirements:** ~5-15GB additional GPU memory (depends on sequence length)

### 1.3 3D Convolutions for Video

#### Spatial-Temporal Feature Learning
3D CNNs extend 2D convolutions to include the temporal dimension, processing (C, T, H, W) tensors to capture motion.

**Key Papers:**
- **I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNets, 2017, Google DeepMind):** Inflates 2D ImageNet weights to 3D
- **SlowFast Networks (2019, Facebook AI):** Dual-pathway architecture with different temporal resolutions
- **S3D (Separable 3D CNN, 2018):** Uses depthwise separable convolutions for efficiency

**I3D Architecture:**
```
Input: (batch, 3, T, H, W)  # T frames
Conv3D layers:
├─ Conv3D(3 → 64, kernel=(3,7,7), stride=(1,2,2))
├─ MaxPool3D(kernel=(1,3,3), stride=(1,2,2))
├─ Conv3D(64 → 192, kernel=(3,3,3))
└─ ... (deeper layers)

Captures both spatial patterns and motion across frames
```

**SlowFast Two-Pathway Design:**
```
Slow pathway (spatial semantics):
├─ Low frame rate (e.g., 2 fps)
├─ High channel capacity (256 channels)
└─ Captures what is happening

Fast pathway (temporal dynamics):
├─ High frame rate (e.g., 16 fps)
├─ Low channel capacity (32 channels)
└─ Captures motion/change

Lateral connections fuse slow and fast features
```

**S3D Efficiency:**
- Factorizes 3D convolution into spatial (2D) + temporal (1D)
- **2.5× more efficient than I3D** (43.47 GFLOPS vs 107.9)
- Similar accuracy (78.0% vs 78.4% on Mini-Kinetics-200)

**Advantages:**
- Standard approach for video understanding
- Naturally captures motion and temporal dynamics
- Can leverage pretrained models (Kinetics, ImageNet)
- Proven effective for action recognition

**Disadvantages:**
- Significantly more parameters than 2D CNNs
- Higher computational cost (FLOPs)
- Requires larger batch sizes for stable training

**Parameter Estimate:** ~50-200M additional parameters
- S3D (efficient): ~50-80M params
- I3D (full): ~150-200M params

**Memory Requirements:** ~10-30GB additional GPU memory (depends on batch size and frame count)

---

### 1.4 Hierarchical Temporal Encoding

#### Multi-Level Temporal Abstraction
Hierarchical approaches process temporal data at multiple levels of abstraction, from fine-grained (frame-level) to coarse-grained (TR-level).

**Key Papers:**
- **Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN, 2017):** Multi-scale spatial features
- **Hierarchical Temporal Structure in Speech (2017):** Phonemes → syllables → words → sentences
- **VideoMAE V2 Dual Masking (2023):** Encoder tube masking + decoder running cell masking

**Architecture Concept:**
```
Fine-grained level (frame/phoneme):
├─ Process individual frames: (64, 512) features per frame
├─ Capture local patterns: edges, phonemes, micro-movements

Mid-level (syllable/motion):
├─ Pool 4-8 frames: (8-16, 512) features
├─ Capture syllables, object motions

Coarse level (TR/word/phrase):
├─ Aggregate to TR: (1, 512) features
└─ Capture semantic content, global context

Learned aggregation: Not simple averaging!
├─ Attention-based pooling
├─ Convolutional downsampling
└─ Temporal max/average pooling with learned weights
```

**Speech Hierarchy (Neuroscience Evidence):**
- **Phonemes:** ~40-60ms (left mid-STG)
- **Syllables:** ~200-400ms
- **Words:** ~300-600ms (left anterior STG)
- **Phrases:** ~1-3 seconds
- **Sentences:** ~3-10 seconds

Music and speech share temporal modulation structure at ~2-4 Hz (critical for speech perception).

**Advantages:**
- Mirrors brain's hierarchical processing
- Preserves information at multiple timescales
- Can route different levels to different purposes (fine → reconstruction, coarse → classification)
- Flexible aggregation to TR-level

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex architecture
- Requires careful design of aggregation mechanisms
- More parameters than single-scale approaches

**Parameter Estimate:** ~20-100M additional parameters
- Lightweight: 3 levels × small networks = ~20M params
- Full hierarchy: 4-5 levels × larger networks = ~100M params

**Memory Requirements:** ~5-20GB additional GPU memory

### 1.5 Temporal Positional Encoding

#### Explicit Time Representation
Add time-since-TR-start as an additional feature channel to encode temporal position.

**Key Papers:**
- **Transformer Positional Encoding (Vaswani et al., 2017):** Sinusoidal position encoding
- **Time2Vec (Kazemi et al., 2019):** Learnable time encoding
- **Positional Encoding for Time Series (2024 survey):** tAPE (time Absolute Position Encoding), eRPE (efficient Relative Position Encoding)

**Architecture:**
```
For 64 frames in a TR:
Frame 0:  [mel_features, 0.000, sin(0.000), cos(0.000)]
Frame 1:  [mel_features, 0.016, sin(0.016), cos(0.016)]
...
Frame 63: [mel_features, 0.984, sin(0.984), cos(0.984)]

Additional channels encode position within TR
Model learns temporal dynamics from position information
```

**Sinusoidal Encoding (Original Transformer):**
```
PE(pos, 2i)   = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))

Captures position at multiple frequencies
Generalizes to unseen sequence lengths
```

**Time-Aware Encoding for Audio-Video Sync:**
- Standard sinusoidal is agnostic to relative time between samples
- Time-aware encoding includes actual time distance:
  ```
  PE(t) = [sin(ω₁t), cos(ω₁t), sin(ω₂t), cos(ω₂t), ...]
  where t = actual time in seconds, ω = learned frequencies
  ```

**Advantages:**
- **Minimal parameter increase** (just additional input channels)
- Simple to implement
- Allows model to learn temporal dynamics
- Compatible with any architecture (CNN, attention, etc.)
- Proven effective in time series transformers

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires model to learn dynamics from encoded position
- Less explicit than dedicated temporal modules
- May not be sufficient alone for complex temporal patterns

**Parameter Estimate:** **Minimal** (~0-5M params)
- Input channel increase: mel_bins → mel_bins + time_encoding_dims
- Slightly larger first layer: ~1-5M additional params

**Memory Requirements:** Negligible (~100MB)

## 2. Audio-Specific Temporal Modeling

### 2.1 Neural Vocoders and Temporal Structure

#### HiFi-GAN Multi-Period Discriminator
HiFi-GAN explicitly models periodic patterns in audio for high-quality reconstruction.

**Key Innovation:**
```
Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD):
├─ Period 2: Reshapes waveform into (T/2, 2) → Detects 2-sample patterns
├─ Period 3: Reshapes waveform into (T/3, 3) → Detects 3-sample patterns
├─ Period 5: Reshapes waveform into (T/5, 5) → Detects 5-sample patterns
└─ Period 7, 11, ...: Detects various periodicities

Multi-Scale Discriminator (MSD):
└─ Operates on raw waveforms at different resolutions

Together: Capture both periodic structure and temporal coherence
```

**Generator (Upsampling):**
```
Input: Mel spectrogram (compressed time)
Transposed convolutions with Multi-Receptive Field Fusion (MRF):
├─ Conv k=3: Short-range dependencies
├─ Conv k=7: Medium-range dependencies
└─ Conv k=11: Long-range dependencies

Concatenate outputs → Rich temporal representation
```

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **Multi-scale receptive fields** crucial for temporal quality
2. **Periodic patterns** matter for audio (though less relevant for mel spectrograms)
3. **Upsampling strategy** important for temporal coherence

**Application to Our Problem:**
- Use multi-receptive field approach in decoder
- When reconstructing mel → audio, consider temporal coherence loss
- Don't rely solely on frame-wise MSE

---

### 2.2 Self-Supervised Speech Models

#### Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT
These models learn temporal features from raw audio through self-supervised learning.

**Wav2Vec 2.0 Architecture:**
```
1. CNN Feature Encoder:
   ├─ 7 Conv1D layers
   ├─ Temporal stride: 10ms → 20ms receptive field
   └─ Learns low-level acoustic features

2. Transformer Context Encoder:
   ├─ 12-24 transformer layers
   ├─ Self-attention over time
   └─ Captures long-range dependencies

3. Contrastive Learning:
   └─ Mask spans of features, predict from context
```

**HuBERT (Hidden-Unit BERT):**
- Uses k-means clustering to create pseudo-labels for masked prediction
- Learns hierarchical acoustic features without supervision
- More stable training than Wav2Vec 2.0

**Temporal Receptive Fields:**
- Wav2Vec 2.0: ~25ms at CNN output, ~400ms at transformer output
- Captures both phoneme-level and word-level patterns

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **CNN for local patterns** + **Transformer for global context** is effective
2. **Multi-scale temporal windows** critical for speech
3. **Self-supervised pretraining** can learn better features than supervised

**Application to Our Problem:**
- Use pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 features as additional input
- Borrow architectural patterns (CNN → Transformer)
- Consider self-supervised pretraining on Sherlock audio

---

### 2.3 Music and Long-Range Temporal Modeling

#### Jukebox and MusicGen
Models for music generation handle very long-range dependencies (minutes).

**Jukebox (OpenAI, 2020):**
```
Hierarchical VQ-VAE with 3 levels:
├─ Top level: Coarse structure (8-16 seconds per token)
├─ Middle level: Melodic patterns (1-2 seconds per token)
└─ Bottom level: Fine audio details (10-25ms per token)

Transformers generate tokens autoregressively at each level
```

**MusicGen (Meta, 2023):**
- Efficiently generates high-quality music (32 kHz, stereo)
- Uses codebook pattern modeling with delay patterns
- Handles temporal coherence over 30+ second clips

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **Hierarchical encoding** essential for long temporal spans
2. **Coarse-to-fine generation** preserves structure at multiple scales
3. **VQ-VAE** can compress temporal information efficiently

**Application to Our Problem:**
- Use hierarchical encoding for 1.5s TR windows
- Coarse level: TR-aligned features for fMRI prediction
- Fine level: Frame-level features for reconstruction

---

## 3. Video-Specific Temporal Modeling

### 3.1 VideoMAE and Masked Autoencoders

#### Temporal Masking Strategy
VideoMAE uses "tube masking" with extremely high masking ratios (90-95%).

**Tube Masking:**
```
Spatiotemporal tubes: Mask same spatial location across all frames
├─ Prevents temporal information leakage
├─ Forces model to learn from context
└─ Handles video redundancy (many frames are similar)

Masking ratio: 90-95% (much higher than image MAE's 75%)
├─ Video has high temporal redundancy
├─ Harder pretext task → Better representations
└─ More data-efficient learning
```

**VideoMAE V2 Dual Masking:**
```
Encoder: Tube masking (90%)
├─ Processes only 10% of tokens
└─ Very efficient encoding

Decoder: Running cell masking
├─ Different mask pattern from encoder
├─ Prevents trivial solutions
└─ Forces reconstruction from diverse contexts
```

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **Video has high temporal redundancy** → Can compress aggressively
2. **Tube masking** better than random masking for video
3. **Dual masking** prevents overfitting to specific patterns

**Application to Our Problem:**
- Use aggressive temporal compression for video (64 frames → intermediate representation)
- Don't treat all frames equally (some are redundant)
- Consider masking-based pretraining on Sherlock video

---

### 3.2 Optical Flow and Motion Encoding

#### Explicit Motion Representation
Optical flow captures pixel-wise motion between frames.

**Flow-Based Approaches:**
```
Input frames: t, t+1
Optical flow: Estimates motion vectors for each pixel
├─ Dense flow: Motion vector at every spatial location
├─ Sparse flow: Motion at keypoints only
└─ Learnable flow: End-to-end flow estimation

Motion encoding:
├─ Separate stream for appearance vs. motion
├─ Two-stream CNNs: RGB + Flow
└─ I3D uses both streams
```

**Recent Methods:**
- **OnlyFlow (Nov 2024):** 198M parameter flow encoder for video diffusion
- **MemFlow (CVPR 2024):** Flow estimation with memory for temporal consistency
- **FlowFormer++ (2023):** Masked cost volume autoencoding for flow

**Frame Difference (Simpler Alternative):**
```
Frame difference: I(t+1) - I(t)
├─ Captures short-term motion
├─ Computationally cheap
├─ Complements appearance features
└─ Used in anomaly detection
```

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **Motion is complementary to appearance** → Process separately
2. **Temporal derivatives** (frame differences) capture change
3. **Flow estimation** expensive but effective

**Application to Our Problem:**
- Add frame difference channel to video encoder
- Compute differences within TR window (captures micro-movements)
- Lightweight: No need for full optical flow estimation

## 4. fMRI-Specific Temporal Modeling

### 4.1 Brain Decoding with Low Temporal Resolution

#### How Recent Papers Handle TR-Level Sampling

**Key Insight:** Despite fMRI's poor temporal resolution (TR = 1.5-2.6s), spectrotemporal modulations can be decoded from **spatial patterns**.

**Santoro et al. (PNAS 2017):**
> "Not only the time-averaged modulation content of sounds but also modulation changes on the order of about 200 ms could be decoded from fMRI response patterns, which is surprising given the low temporal resolution of fMRI and coarse temporal sampling with TR = 2.6 s."

**Mechanism:**
- Different temporal modulations create distinct spatial activation patterns
- ~2-4 Hz modulations (speech-relevant) reconstructed more faithfully
- Spatial fMRI patterns encode temporal dynamics of stimuli

**Recent Papers:**

1. **Reverse the Auditory Pathway (2024):**
   - Coarse-to-fine audio reconstruction from fMRI
   - Semantic → Acoustic → Spectrogram → Audio
   - Accounts for hemodynamic lag (4 seconds)
   - Achieves ~70% identification accuracy

2. **SIM: Surface-based Multimodal Decoding (2025):**
   - Tri-modal CLIP alignment (audio + video + fMRI)
   - Surface-based analysis on cortical mesh
   - Handles movie watching experiments

3. **Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles (2025):**
   - Maps video, audio, language embeddings → fMRI time series
   - Trained on ~80 hours of movie watching
   - Uses pretrained embeddings + recurrent aggregation

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **TR-level sampling is acceptable** if spatial patterns are rich
2. **Hemodynamic lag** must be accounted for (typically 4-6 seconds)
3. **Pretrained embeddings** help bridge modality gap
4. **Temporal aggregation** within TR window preserves information

---

### 4.2 Temporal Alignment Strategies

#### Handling Stimulus-fMRI Temporal Mismatch

**Current Problem:**
- Video: 30 fps (33ms per frame)
- Audio: 64 mel frames per TR (23ms per frame)
- fMRI: 1 sample per 1.5s
- Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF): ~4-6s lag and blur

**State-of-the-Art Approaches:**

1. **Temporal Binning with Lag:**
   ```
   Audio clip at time t
   → Corresponds to fMRI at time t + 4s (HRF lag)
   → Aggregate all frames within TR window
   → Use aggregated features for prediction
   ```

2. **Learned Temporal Kernels:**
   ```
   Instead of simple averaging:
   - Learn attention weights over frames within TR
   - Different weights for different brain regions
   - Adaptive pooling based on content
   ```

3. **Multi-TR Context:**
   ```
   Don't just use current TR:
   - Include previous 2-3 TRs (captures HRF temporal extent)
   - Include following 1-2 TRs (backward connections in brain)
   - Temporal convolutional layers over TR sequence
   ```

4. **HRF Deconvolution:**
   ```
   Instead of matching blurred fMRI:
   - Deconvolve HRF to get neuronal response
   - Match stimulus to deconvolved signal
   - More direct mapping
   ```

**Temporal Aggregation Methods:**
```python
# Simple averaging (current approach - LOSSY)
features_per_tr = torch.mean(frames, dim=time_axis)

# Learned attention aggregation (BETTER)
attention_weights = attention_net(frames)  # (B, T, 1)
features_per_tr = torch.sum(frames * attention_weights, dim=time_axis)

# Multi-scale aggregation (BEST)
coarse = pool_coarse(frames)   # Long-term structure
fine = pool_fine(frames)       # Short-term details
features_per_tr = concat([coarse, fine])
```

**Lessons for Our Architecture:**
1. **Don't just average** frames within TR
2. **Learn aggregation weights** (attention or conv)
3. **Preserve multi-scale information** even after aggregation
4. **Account for HRF lag** in training (4-6 second offset)

## 5. Parameter Efficiency Techniques

### 5.1 Depthwise Separable Convolutions

#### Reducing Parameters While Maintaining Capacity

**Standard Convolution:**
```
Input: (C_in, H, W)
Output: (C_out, H, W)
Parameters: C_in × C_out × k × k
Example: 256 → 512, k=3 → 256 × 512 × 9 = 1,179,648 params
```

**Depthwise Separable Convolution:**
```
Step 1 - Depthwise: Each input channel convolved separately
  Input: (C_in, H, W)
  Output: (C_in, H, W)
  Parameters: C_in × k × k

Step 2 - Pointwise: 1×1 convolution across channels
  Input: (C_in, H, W)
  Output: (C_out, H, W)
  Parameters: C_in × C_out × 1 × 1

Total parameters: C_in × k² + C_in × C_out
Example: 256 × 9 + 256 × 512 = 133,376 params (8.8× reduction!)
```

**Applications:**
- **MobileNets:** Image classification with <1M params
- **S3D:** Video understanding (2.5× more efficient than I3D)
- **AudioRWKV (2024):** Audio pattern recognition with 2D depthwise separable conv on spectrograms

**Advantages:**
- 5-10× parameter reduction
- Similar or better accuracy (more efficient representation)
- Faster training and inference
- Less prone to overfitting

**Application to Our Problem:**
Replace standard Conv1D/Conv2D/Conv3D with depthwise separable versions:
```python
# Replace this:
nn.Conv1d(in_channels=256, out_channels=512, kernel_size=3)

# With this:
nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv1d(in_channels=256, out_channels=256, kernel_size=3, groups=256),  # Depthwise
    nn.Conv1d(in_channels=256, out_channels=512, kernel_size=1)  # Pointwise
)
```

**Parameter Savings for Our Model:**
- Current audio encoder Conv1D params: ~8.5M
- With depthwise separable: ~1.5M (5.7× reduction)
- Current video encoder Conv2D params: ~16.1M
- With depthwise separable: ~3.2M (5.0× reduction)

---

### 5.2 Efficient Attention Mechanisms

#### Reducing Quadratic Complexity

**Problem with Standard Attention:**
```
Complexity: O(N²d) where N = sequence length, d = model dimension
Memory: O(N²) for attention matrix
For N=64 frames: 64² = 4,096 attention scores per head
For 8 heads: 32,768 scores
```

**FlashAttention (2022):**
- IO-aware algorithm: Minimizes GPU memory reads/writes
- Exact attention (not approximate)
- 2-4× faster than standard attention
- Enables longer sequences with same memory

**Linear Attention:**
```
Standard: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T)V  [O(N²d)]

Linear: Attention(Q,K,V) = φ(Q)(φ(K)^T V)  [O(Nd²)]
  where φ is feature map (e.g., ReLU, ELU+1)

Key insight: Change order of operations to avoid N² term
```

**Gated Linear Attention (GLA, 2024):**
- Combines linear attention with gating mechanism
- **Faster than FlashAttention-2** even on short sequences (1K tokens)
- Enables ~20K sequence lengths
- Competitive with LLaMA on language tasks

**Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA, 2025):**
- Novel kernel for linear RNNs
- Outperforms FlashAttention, Mamba on long sequences
- Arbitrary chunk sizes for flexible processing

**Application to Our Problem:**
```python
# Standard attention over 64 frames:
attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=512, num_heads=8)
output = attn(frames, frames, frames)  # O(64² × 512) = O(2M ops)

# Linear attention over 64 frames:
linear_attn = GatedLinearAttention(embed_dim=512, num_heads=8)
output = linear_attn(frames, frames, frames)  # O(64 × 512²) = O(16M ops)
# Still O(N) in sequence length!
```

**Recommendations:**
- Use **FlashAttention** if using standard attention (drop-in replacement)
- Use **Linear Attention** for very long sequences (>1000 frames)
- For our use case (64 frames per TR): Standard attention with FlashAttention is sufficient

### 5.3 Knowledge Distillation

#### Learning from Larger Models

**Concept:**
Train a small "student" model to mimic a large "teacher" model.

**Process:**
```
1. Train large teacher model (e.g., with full temporal attention)
2. Train small student model to match teacher's outputs
3. Student learns compressed representation of teacher's knowledge
4. Deploy only student model (smaller, faster)
```

**Distillation Loss:**
```python
# Soft targets from teacher
teacher_logits = teacher_model(input)
teacher_probs = softmax(teacher_logits / temperature)

# Student predictions
student_logits = student_model(input)
student_probs = softmax(student_logits / temperature)

# Distillation loss (KL divergence)
distill_loss = KL(teacher_probs || student_probs)

# Combined loss
total_loss = α * task_loss + (1-α) * distill_loss
```

**Application to Our Problem:**
1. Train large model with full temporal attention (teacher)
2. Train smaller model with multi-scale convolutions (student)
3. Student achieves 80-90% of teacher's performance with 50% params

**Benefit:** Get best of both worlds (quality + efficiency)

---

## 6. Recommended Approaches: Detailed Analysis

### 6.1 TIER 1: Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution + Positional Encoding

#### Combined Architecture

**Rationale:** Best balance of performance, efficiency, and implementation simplicity.

**Architecture:**
```python
class TemporalMultiScaleEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=128, hidden_dim=256):
        # Temporal positional encoding
        self.pos_encoder = TemporalPositionalEncoding(input_dim)

        # Multi-scale temporal convolution branches
        self.conv_k1 = nn.Conv1d(input_dim, hidden_dim, kernel_size=1, padding=0)

### 6.2 TIER 1: Hierarchical Temporal Encoding with Learned Pooling

#### Three-Level Temporal Hierarchy

**Architecture:**
```python
class HierarchicalTemporalEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=128):
        # Fine-grained level: Frame-level features
        self.fine_encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv1d(input_dim, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(256),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        # Mid-level: Syllable/motion level (pool 8 frames → 1)
        self.mid_pooling = nn.Conv1d(256, 256, kernel_size=8, stride=8)
        self.mid_encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv1d(256, 512, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(512),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        # Coarse level: TR-level (pool 8 → 1)
        self.coarse_pooling = nn.Conv1d(512, 512, kernel_size=8, stride=8)
        self.coarse_encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(512),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        # Cross-level fusion
        self.fusion = nn.Linear(256 + 512 + 512, 512)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (batch, 64, 128)
        x = x.transpose(1, 2)  # (batch, 128, 64)

        # Fine level (64 frames)
        fine = self.fine_encoder(x)  # (batch, 256, 64)
        fine_pooled = F.adaptive_avg_pool1d(fine, 1).squeeze(-1)  # (batch, 256)

        # Mid level (8 segments of 8 frames)
        mid = self.mid_pooling(fine)  # (batch, 256, 8)
        mid = self.mid_encoder(mid)   # (batch, 512, 8)
        mid_pooled = F.adaptive_avg_pool1d(mid, 1).squeeze(-1)  # (batch, 512)

        # Coarse level (1 TR)
        coarse = self.coarse_pooling(mid)  # (batch, 512, 1)
        coarse = self.coarse_encoder(coarse.squeeze(-1))  # (batch, 512)

        # Fuse all levels
        fused = torch.cat([fine_pooled, mid_pooled, coarse], dim=1)  # (batch, 1280)
        output = self.fusion(fused)  # (batch, 512)

        return output
```

**Temporal Hierarchy:**
```
64 frames (1.5s TR)
│
├─ Fine level: 64 frames × 23ms = Individual phonemes, micro-movements
│  → Conv1D with k=3 captures local patterns
│
├─ Mid level: 8 segments × 8 frames = Syllables, short motions (~180ms each)
│  → Pooling 8→1, then Conv1D captures segment structure
│
└─ Coarse level: 1 TR = Words, global context
   → Final aggregation preserves overall semantic content
```

**Parameter Count:**
```
Fine encoder: 128 × 256 × 3 = 98K params
Mid pooling: 256 × 256 × 8 = 524K params
Mid encoder: 256 × 512 × 3 = 393K params
Coarse pooling: 512 × 512 × 8 = 2.1M params
Coarse encoder: 512 × 512 = 262K params
Fusion: 1280 × 512 = 655K params
Total: ~4M params (still lightweight!)
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves information at multiple temporal scales
- Mirrors brain's hierarchical processing
- Fine level → Decoder reconstruction (detailed audio/video)
- Coarse level → fMRI prediction (semantic content)
- Learned pooling better than averaging

**Comparison to Simple Averaging:**
```
Current approach: mean(64 frames) → Loses ALL temporal detail
Hierarchical: Preserves structure at 3 levels → Recovers temporal patterns
```

**Expected Improvement:**
- Audio quality: **High** - preserves hierarchical speech structure
- Video quality: **High** - preserves motion at multiple scales
- fMRI prediction: **Moderate** - coarse level already good for fMRI

        x = self.fc(x)  # (B, 1024)
        return x
```

**Parameter Count:**
```
Each S3D block:
  Spatial 2D conv: in × out × 3 × 3 ≈ in × out × 9
  Temporal 1D conv: out × out × 3 ≈ out² × 3
  BatchNorm: 2 × out

Block 1 (3→64): 3 × 64 × 9 + 64² × 3 = 1,728 + 12,288 = 14K
Block 2 (64→128): 64 × 128 × 9 + 128² × 3 = 73,728 + 49,152 = 123K
Block 3 (128→256): 128 × 256 × 9 + 256² × 3 = 294,912 + 196,608 = 491K

```

**Comparison to Current 2D CNN:**
```
Current VideoEncoder: 16.1M params, NO temporal modeling
S3D VideoEncoder: 3.1M params, WITH temporal modeling
Result: 5× fewer params + motion capture!
```

**Benefits:**

**Expected Improvement:**

#### Efficient Self-Attention Over Time

**Architecture:**
```python
class TemporalTransformerEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=128, d_model=512, nhead=8, num_layers=4):
        self.input_projection = nn.Linear(input_dim, d_model)
        self.pos_encoder = TemporalPositionalEncoding(d_model)

        # Transformer encoder with FlashAttention
        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
            d_model=d_model,
            nhead=nhead,
            dim_feedforward=2048,
            batch_first=True
        )
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)

        # Aggregate to TR level
        self.aggregation = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (batch, time=64, features=128)

        # Project to model dimension
        x = self.input_projection(x)  # (batch, 64, 512)

        # Add positional encoding
        x = self.pos_encoder(x)

        # Transformer encoding
        x = self.transformer(x)  # (batch, 64, 512)

        # Aggregate over time (learned attention pooling)
        attention_weights = F.softmax(self.aggregation(x), dim=1)  # (batch, 64, 512)
        aggregated = torch.sum(x * attention_weights, dim=1)  # (batch, 512)

        return aggregated
```

**Parameter Count:**
```
Input projection: 128 × 512 = 65K params
Per transformer layer:
  Self-attention: 4 × (512 × 512) = 1M params (Q, K, V, output projections)
  FFN: 512 × 2048 + 2048 × 512 = 2M params
  Total per layer: ~3M params

4 layers: 4 × 3M = 12M params
Aggregation: 512 × 512 = 262K params

Total: ~12.3M params
```

**With FlashAttention:**
- Same parameters, but 2-4× faster training
- Enables larger batch sizes (less memory for attention matrices)
- No approximation (exact attention)

**Benefits:**
- Learns adaptive importance weights for frames
- Captures long-range dependencies
- State-of-the-art for sequence modeling
- Proven effective in video understanding (TimeSformer)

**Disadvantages:**
- More parameters than convolutional approaches
- Requires more data to train effectively
- Slower inference than CNNs

**Expected Improvement:**
- Audio quality: **High** - learns which frames matter most
- Video quality: **High** - adaptive temporal pooling
- Training cost: **High** - needs more compute
