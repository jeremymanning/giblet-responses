# Temporal Modeling Research: Executive Summary

## The Problem

**Current Issue:** Audio reconstruction loses ALL temporal detail (speech, music, sound effects) due to averaging ~64 mel frames per TR (1.5s). Video similarly loses motion information.

**Root Cause:** Simple mean pooling destroys temporal dynamics:
```python
# Current approach (LOSSY):
features_per_tr = torch.mean(frames, dim=time_axis)  # All 64 frames ‚Üí single vector

# Result: Phonemes, syllables, words, motion ‚Üí All lost
```

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
**Implement:** Multi-Scale Conv + Positional Encoding

**Why:**
- Easiest to implement (3-4 days)
- Biggest impact for effort

2. Add `MultiScaleConv1D` module (100 lines)
3. Replace audio/video encoder final layers
4. Update dataset to preserve temporal dimension

**Expected result:**
- Audio becomes intelligible (speech/music structure preserved)
- Video motion coherence improved
- Ready for testing in 1 week

4. Integrate with bottleneck

**Expected result:**
- 85-95% temporal preservation

## Key Insights from Literature

### 1. fMRI TR Sampling Is Acceptable
Despite poor temporal resolution (1.5s), spatial fMRI patterns encode temporal dynamics:

> "Modulation changes on the order of about 200 ms could be decoded from fMRI response patterns, which is surprising given TR = 2.6s." ‚Äî Santoro et al., PNAS 2017

**Implication:** Don't need to match fMRI temporal resolution. Preserve fine-grained features for reconstruction.

---

### 2. Hierarchical Structure Matters
Speech and music have temporal hierarchies:
- **Phonemes:** ~40-60ms
- **Syllables:** ~200-400ms
- **Words:** ~300-600ms
- **Phrases:** ~1-3 seconds

Brain processes these at different cortical levels (mid-STG ‚Üí anterior STG).

**Implication:** Use hierarchical encoding to match brain processing.

---

### 3. Simple Averaging Is Harmful
Current approach:
```python
mean(64 frames) ‚Üí Single vector ‚Üí Decoder ‚Üí 64 reconstructed frames
```

**Problem:** Decoder has no temporal information to reconstruct from!

**Solution:** Preserve multi-scale temporal structure:
```python
Fine (64 frames) + Mid (8 segments) + Coarse (1 TR) ‚Üí Rich representation
```

---

### 4. Multi-Scale Receptive Fields Are Critical
HiFi-GAN vocoder quality comes from:
- Multi-Period Discriminator (captures periodicities)
- Multi-Receptive Field Fusion (short + medium + long-range)

**Implication:** Use parallel conv branches with different kernel sizes.

---

### 5. 3D CNN Is Standard for Video
Video understanding benchmarks (Kinetics, UCF-101):
- I3D: 150M params, 107.9 GFLOPS
- S3D: 50M params, 43.47 GFLOPS (2.5√ó more efficient, same accuracy!)

**Implication:** Factorized 3D conv (spatial + temporal) is best practice.

---
