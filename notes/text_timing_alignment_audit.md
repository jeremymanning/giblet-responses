# Text Timing Alignment Audit - Oct 29, 2024

## Summary

**RESULT: ✓ IMPLEMENTATION IS CORRECT**

The text alignment implementation in `/Users/jmanning/giblet-responses/giblet/data/text.py` correctly uses the Start Time (s) and End Time (s) columns from `data/annotations.xlsx` and properly aligns annotations to fMRI TRs.

---

## Audit Details

### 1. Timing Columns Usage

**File:** `giblet/data/text.py`, lines 206-220

The implementation correctly:
- ✓ Uses `Start Time (s)` column for annotation start times
- ✓ Uses `End Time (s)` column for annotation end times
- ✓ Loads these from the Excel file (line 114)

```python
start_time = row['Start Time (s)']
end_time = row['End Time (s)']
```

### 2. TR Alignment Logic

**Algorithm (lines 211-220):**
```python
start_tr = int(np.floor(start_time / self.tr))
end_tr = int(np.ceil(end_time / self.tr))
for tr_idx in range(start_tr, end_tr):
    tr_contributors[tr_idx].append(seg_idx)
```

**Verification:**
- ✓ Correctly implements overlap detection
- ✓ TR i covers time window [i × 1.5, (i+1) × 1.5) seconds
- ✓ Annotation [start, end] contributes to TR i if: start < (i+1)×1.5 AND end > i×1.5
- ✓ The floor/ceil approach mathematically equivalent to overlap check

**Test Results:**
- Segment at 0-12s maps to TRs 0-7 ✓
- Segment at 12-15s maps to TRs 8-9 ✓
- Segment at 39-40s maps to TR 26 ✓
- All edge cases tested and verified ✓

### 3. Aggregation Strategy

**Implementation (lines 229-243):**
- Multiple annotations can overlap the same TR
- Default aggregation: `mean` (averages overlapping embeddings)
- Other options: `first`, `last`, `max`

**Dataset Note:**
- Annotations contain duplicates (segments 1-479 duplicated as 483-961)
- This is a data issue, not a code issue
- Mean aggregation correctly handles duplicates

**Coverage:**
- 918 out of 920 TRs have multiple overlapping annotations
- 2 TRs have exactly 1 annotation
- 0 TRs have gaps (no annotations)

### 4. Gap Filling Strategy

**Implementation (lines 260-329):**
- Default: `forward_fill` (propagate last valid value)
- Other options: `zero`, `interpolate`
- No gaps exist in current dataset for TRs 0-919

### 5. Truncation to 920 TRs

**Dataset Coverage:**
- Annotations span: 0s - 1544s (25.7 minutes)
- fMRI data: 920 TRs (0s - 1380s, 23 minutes)
- TRs needed for full annotation coverage: 1030

**Truncation (lines 215-216):**
```python
start_tr = max(0, start_tr)
end_tr = min(n_trs, end_tr)
```
- ✓ Correctly clamps to [0, 920) range
- ✓ 80 annotations beyond TR 920 are properly ignored

### 6. Integration with sync.py

**File:** `giblet/alignment/sync.py`, lines 168-170

```python
target_trs = min(n_video, n_audio, n_text, n_fmri)
```

- ✓ Aligns all modalities to minimum TR count
- ✓ For Sherlock: fMRI (920 TRs) is the minimum
- ✓ Text processor called with `n_trs=920`
- ✓ All modalities aligned to common 920 TR grid

## First 10 TR Mappings

Manual verification of TR-to-annotation mappings:

| TR | Time Window | Segments | Annotations |
|----|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 0  | [0.0s - 1.5s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 1  | [1.5s - 3.0s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 2  | [3.0s - 4.5s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 3  | [4.5s - 6.0s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 4  | [6.0s - 7.5s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 5  | [7.5s - 9.0s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 6  | [9.0s - 10.5s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 7  | [10.5s - 12.0s) | 2 | Seg 0 [0-12s], Seg 482 [0-12s] |
| 8  | [12.0s - 13.5s) | 2 | Seg 1 [12-15s], Seg 483 [12-15s] |
| 9  | [13.5s - 15.0s) | 2 | Seg 1 [12-15s], Seg 483 [12-15s] |

*Note: Segments 0 and 482 are duplicates (same timing, same text)*

## Edge Cases Verified

### Case 1: Annotation at video start (0-12s)
- **Expected:** TRs 0-7
- **Actual:** TRs 0-7 ✓
- **Calculation:** floor(0/1.5)=0, ceil(12/1.5)=8, range(0,8)=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

### Case 2: Annotation at exact TR boundary (12-15s)
- **Expected:** TRs 8-9
