# Implementation Session - Issue #2
Date: 2025-10-28
Status: In Progress

## Current Progress

### ✅ Completed (Commits: 95cf03c)
1. Project structure created
2. requirements.txt with all dependencies
3. **Video processing module** (`giblet/data/video.py`)
   - Tested with real Sherlock video
   - Round-trip PSNR: 35.37 dB ✓
   - 950 TRs extracted (TR=1.5s)

4. **Audio processing module** (`giblet/data/audio.py`)
   - Mel spectrogram extraction working
   - 946 TRs extracted
   - Note: torchaudio has version conflict, using Griffin-Lim fallback

### 🔄 In Progress
- Text processing module

### ⚠️ Known Issues & Decisions
1. **Audio reconstruction - using Griffin-Lim for now**:
   - torchaudio 2.9+ removed HiFi-GAN bundles
   - speechbrain incompatible with torchaudio 2.9
   - **Decision**: Implement working Griffin-Lim, upgrade to HiFi-GAN in #8
   - Audio EXTRACTION working perfectly (946 TRs, 128 mels) ✓
   - This doesn't block encoder training (only affects decoder quality)
   - Moving forward with complete implementation

### 📋 Remaining Tasks
- Text processing (3 tasks)
- fMRI processing (2 tasks)
- Temporal alignment (3 tasks)
- Model architecture (3 tasks)
- Training infrastructure (2 tasks)
- Integration tests (1 task)
- Cluster setup (1 task)
- Documentation (1 task)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **TR = 1.5 seconds** (not 1.0s)
2. **Truncate to ~920-950 TRs** (stimulus duration)
3. **83,300 brain voxels** (69% of volume excluded)
4. **Video downsampling**: 640×360 → 160×90
5. **Audio**: 128 mel bins at 22.05 kHz

## Issues Encountered

1. **torchaudio version conflict**: Symbol not found error
   - Workaround: Made HiFi-GAN optional, fallback to Griffin-Lim
   - Will fix in cluster environment with proper torch/torchaudio versions

## Next Steps

1. Test audio round-trip with Griffin-Lim
2. Implement text processing
3. Implement fMRI processing (critical - 17 subjects)
4. Continue with plan...

## Important Notes

- All tests using REAL Sherlock data
- No mocks or simulations
- Quality metrics validated on actual files
- Commit frequency: After each module completion
