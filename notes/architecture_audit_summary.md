# Architecture Audit - Executive Summary

**Issue #11:** Audit architecture compliance with Issue #2 specification
**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✓ SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIANT with 1 critical issue

---

## Quick Status

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 11-layer architecture | ✓ PASS | All layers implemented |
| Parallel branches (2A/B/C, 10A/B/C) | ✓ PASS | Three modalities processed independently |
| 8,000-dim bottleneck (L6) | ✓ PASS | Exactly 8,000 as specified |
| 85,810 voxel expansion (L5) | ✓ PASS | Exactly 85,810 as specified |
| Symmetric encoder-decoder | ✓ PASS | Decoder mirrors encoder |
| **L6 is smallest layer** | **✗ FAIL** | **L6=8,000 but L7=2,048 (smaller!)** |

## Critical Issue: Bottleneck Location

### The Problem

**Issue #2 specification states:**
> "Layer 6: ... This is the middle (smallest) layer!!"

**Current implementation:**
- Layer 5: 4,096 dimensions
- **Layer 6: 8,000 dimensions** ← Spec says this should be smallest
- **Layer 7: 2,048 dimensions** ← Actually smallest in main pathway!

**Visual evidence:** See `notes/dimension_flow.png`

### Impact

The architecture violates the fundamental autoencoder principle:
- Encoder should **compress** from input to bottleneck
- Current L5→L6 **expands** from 4,096 to 8,000
- Then L6→L7 **compresses** from 8,000 to 2,048

**The true bottleneck is Layer 7, not Layer 6.**

## Architecture Comparison

### Main Pathway Dimension Flow

```
INPUT → ENCODER → BOTTLENECK → DECODER → OUTPUT
46,272 → 1,536 → 4,096 → 8,000 → 2,048 → 4,096 → 8,192 → 43,200
         (L3)    (L5)    (L6)    (L7)    (L8)    (L9)    (L11)
                          ↑        ↑
                   Spec says    Actually
                   smallest    smallest!
```

### What Should Happen

**Option A - Make L6 truly smallest:**
```
L5: 1,536 → 8,000 (expand)
L6: 8,000 → 2,000 (compress - TRUE BOTTLENECK)
L7: 2,000 → 8,000 (expand)
```

**Option B - Reduce L6 below L5:**
```
L5: 1,536 → 4,096 (expand)
L6: 4,096 → 2,000 (compress - TRUE BOTTLENECK)
L7: 2,000 → 4,096 (expand)
```

**Option C - Accept current and update spec:**
```
Acknowledge that L7 (2,048) is the actual bottleneck
Rename or renumber layers accordingly
```

## Recommendations

### PRIORITY 1: Resolve Bottleneck Issue (REQUIRED)

**Action needed:** Team discussion to decide:
1. Restructure L5-L6-L7 to make L6 the true smallest layer?
2. Accept current architecture and update specification?
3. Different approach?

**Timeline:** Should resolve before training begins

### PRIORITY 2: Test on Real Data

**Action needed:**
- Load Sherlock fMRI data
- Run forward pass with real video/audio/text
- Verify dimensions match dataset
- Profile memory usage on A6000 GPUs

**Timeline:** Part of Phase 2 cluster deployment (Issue #20)

## Conclusion

The implementation is **93% compliant** with the Issue #2 specification. The **single critical issue** is that Layer 6 is not the smallest layer as specified. This requires discussion and resolution before training.

**Recommendation:** Architecture is production-ready pending resolution of bottleneck sizing issue.
