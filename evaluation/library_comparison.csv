Use Case,Primary Choice,Secondary Choice,Notes
Architecture Diagrams,torchview,custom_matplotlib,Use torchview for horizontal layout showing parallel branches
Debugging,torchviz,torchview,torchviz shows computational graph for gradient flow
Documentation,torchview,custom_matplotlib,Professional appearance with automatic annotations
Quick Inspection,torchviz,N/A,Simplest API for fast checks
Publications,torchview,custom_matplotlib,High-quality PDF/SVG export

Key Finding,Details
Best Library,torchview - Handles large models with horizontal layout and clear parallel branch visualization
Runner-up,torchviz - Excellent for computational graphs but less suitable for architecture diagrams
Custom Option,Keep existing matplotlib code for cases requiring full styling control
Failed Libraries,visualtorch (API issues) and hiddenlayer (outdated multi-input support)
Critical Feature,Horizontal orientation is essential for showing parallel encoder/decoder branches

Installation Command,Library
pip install torchview,torchview (recommended)
conda install -c conda-forge torchview,torchview (recommended via conda)
pip install torchviz,torchviz (alternative)
Already in codebase,custom_matplotlib
