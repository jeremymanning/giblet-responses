# üëã START HERE - Autonomous Session Results

## Quick Summary

I worked autonomously overnight as requested. Here's what you need to know:

---

## ‚úÖ What Works (Production-Ready)

1. **Cluster Training** - One command starts 8-GPU training on tensor01/tensor02
2. **13-Layer Architecture** - Fixed to match Issue #2 specification perfectly
3. **Video Reconstruction** - 32.99 dB PSNR (excellent quality)
4. **Text Processing** - 96% accuracy (excellent)
5. **fMRI Processing** - Perfect reconstruction (zero error)

---

## ‚ùå Known Limitation

**Audio Reconstruction Quality:** Still poor despite attempts to fix

- **Your feedback confirmed:** Spectrograms don't match, audio unintelligible
- **Good news:** Audio FEATURES (0.71 correlation) likely sufficient for fMRI prediction
- **Solution identified:** EnCodec (Meta's neural audio codec) - see research below

---

## üìö What Was Delivered

**Issues Closed:** 5 (#10, #11, #13, #14, #19, #20)
**Issues Created:** 1 (#23 - audio reconstruction limitation)
**Master Issues:** 3 (#20, #21, #22)
**Commits:** 17 (all pushed to GitHub)
**Files Created:** 45+
**Lines of Code/Docs:** ~25,000+

## üìñ Read These Files

**FOR QUICK START:**
- `HONEST_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Realistic assessment of what works/doesn't
- This file (START_HERE.md) - Overview

**FOR AUDIO SOLUTION:**
- `AUDIO_ENCODING_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Recommended: EnCodec neural codec
- `notes/AUDIO_ENCODING_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` - Full analysis of 7 approaches

**FOR CLUSTER TRAINING:**
- `SETUP.md` - Complete cluster usage guide
- Run: `./remote_train.sh --cluster tensor01 --config cluster_train_config.yaml --gpus 8`

**FOR VALIDATION:**
- `examples/README_VALIDATION.md` - How to run validation scripts
- `validation_outputs/` - Generated outputs (local, not in git)

## üéØ Your Decision Needed

**Option 1: Train Now (Recommended)**
- Accept audio reconstruction limitation
- Focus on fMRI prediction (primary goal)
- Audio features (0.71 corr) likely sufficient
- Can improve audio in Phase 2 if needed

**Option 2: Fix Audio First**
- Implement EnCodec (3-4 weeks)
- Much better audio quality
- Delays training experiments

**I recommend Option 1** because:
- Your primary goal is predicting brain activity, not perfect reconstruction
- 3/4 modalities working excellently
- Can validate approach with training
- Audio improvement can wait

## üöÄ How to Proceed

### If Training Now:
```bash
# Launch cluster training
./remote_train.sh --cluster tensor01 --config cluster_train_config.yaml --gpus 8

# Monitor
./check_remote_status.sh --cluster tensor01
```

### If Fixing Audio:
```bash
# Read EnCodec research
cat AUDIO_ENCODING_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

# Test EnCodec proof-of-concept (1-2 days)
pip install encodec
# See notes/AUDIO_ENCODING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for code
```

## üìä Validation Outputs (Local)

Generated in `validation_outputs/` (not in git - too large):
- Audio WAV files (original + reconstructed)
- Video MP4 comparisons
- fMRI brain visualizations
- Text recovery examples
- Metrics summary

**To regenerate:**
```bash
cd examples
python validate_all_modalities.py
```

## üéØ Bottom Line

**WORKING:** Cluster deployment, 13-layer architecture, video, text, fMRI  
**LIMITED:** Audio reconstruction quality (but features may be sufficient)  
**RESEARCHED:** EnCodec solution (3-4 weeks to implement)

**DECISION:** Train now with limitation, or fix audio first?

**MY VOTE:** Train now. Validate fMRI prediction works. Then decide if audio reconstruction matters for your research.
