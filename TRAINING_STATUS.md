# Training Status Report

## Current Status: ⚠️ BLOCKED

Training failed during data preprocessing with EnCodec dimension mismatch.

### Error

```
RuntimeError: stack expects each tensor to be equal size, but got [1, 4, 106697] at entry 0 and [1, 0, 106705] at entry 1
```

Different TRs producing different numbers of EnCodec codebooks (4 vs 0).

### What Happened

1. ✅ Cluster deployment working (code synced)
2. ✅ Screen session launched
3. ✅ Environment active (ffmpeg installed)
4. ✅ Video processing working
5. ❌ Audio EnCodec encoding failed (dimension mismatch)

### Issue Created

**#25:** EnCodec dimension mismatch during training
- Documents the error
- Tracked for fixing

### Next Steps

**Option 1:** Fix EnCodec dimension handling
- Ensure consistent codebook count
- Add padding/normalization
- Relaunch training

**Option 2:** Temporarily use mel spectrograms
- Set `use_encodec: false` in config
- Train with original mel approach
- Fix EnCodec in parallel

### Recommendation

Given context limits (~548K / 1M), recommend:
1. Document current state
2. Create notes for next session
3. User can choose: Fix EnCodec now or train with mel spectrograms
